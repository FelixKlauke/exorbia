# Exorbia

Exorbia is a simple and easy to use NoSQL Document oriented database written in Java to show and practice the main ideas of a no sql database. Still under heavy development and not ready to use. We will use a binary backend on the disk or maybe even off heap and will provide three types of documents:
- JSON Document
- Raw Text Document
- Binary Document
